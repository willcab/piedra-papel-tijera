## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This is a rock-paper-scissors game made with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The user plays against "the PC" and the game has a score counter. Additionally, it shows whether the user won, lost, or tied depending on the result.

## How to play
To play the game, simply load the index.html file in your web browser. You'll see three buttons: one for selecting rock, one for selecting paper, and one for selecting scissors. Click the button corresponding to your choice. The PC will choose an option at random, and it will be shown who won the game.

The game has a score counter that updates after each game. If you win, your score increases by 1. If you lose, the PC's score increases by 1. If you tie, the score doesn't change.
